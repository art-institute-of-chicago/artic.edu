# Images

Images on the frontend are provided by Twill's [Media Library](https://twill.io/docs/#media-library-3) as well as the Art Institute of Chicago's collections digital asset management system (DAMS) via the API. Eloquent models as well as our API models can provide images to the frontend.



## API models

Use the `HasMediasApi` trait in the API models you want to load images. This behavior adds a method with the same prototype as Twill so we can show images from the CMS or API models indistinctly.


```php
use Aic\Hub\Foundation\Library\Api\Models\Behaviors\HasMediasApi;

class Artwork extends BaseApiModel
{
    use HasMediasApi;
}
```

After that you should define your roles and crops:


```php
public $mediasParams = [
    'hero' => [
        'default' => [
        ],
        'thumbnail' => [
            'field'  => 'image_id',
            'width'  => 30,
        ],
        'small' => [
            'field'  => 'image_id',
            'width'  => 30,
            'height'  => 45,
        ],
    ],
];

```

Possible parameters (all optional):

`field`: API field containing the image ID. Typically this will be `image_id`.
`width`: Width for this image
`height`: Height for this image



## Eloquent/Twill Models

Use the [`HasMediasEloquent`](../app/Models/Behaviors/HasMediaEloquent) trait in the Twill models you want to load images.


```php
use App\Models\Behaviors\HasMediasEloquent;

class Event extends Model
{
    use HasSlug, HasMediasEloquent;
}
```

This will just add an extra function to access the image and apply the `ImageHelpers::aic_convertFromImage` function.



## How to use it

The `imageFront($role, $crop)` function is used in both these traits to retrieve images. You can call the same function on either type of modelâ€”API or Eloquent. Having the same method prototype ensures that you can augment API models and perform a call to retrieve images without regard to whether it's an API or Twill model.
